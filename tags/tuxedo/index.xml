      <description>Hello friends, here is my cat, Mour-mour (å“žå“žå„¿). Mour is a one-year-old, lively boy. I am so happy to live with him as his father, and we both love his mom ðŸ‘ª. Here are some pictures of him. Please enjoy them! [2020-11-30] Mour-mour is sleeping on my table. [2020-11-22] Mour-mour is lying down on my desk (just finish eating his favorite turkey snack).
